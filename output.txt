- Improvements -
1) Fixed the glitch with the two periods.
2) Used a reverseDictionary(dictionary) function to create a dictionary in which the keys and values swap.
3) Rather than having only hard coded strings to translate, the program takes a user input and translates it.
4) Cases involving words that contained both capital and non-capital variants throughout the sentences taken into account and corrected.
5) Support added to accommodate French words with special characters that have accents. (ÂÇÆÉÈÊËÏÎÔŒÙÛÜŸàâçæéèêëïîôœùûüÿ)
6) Fixed occurrences where the word 'Je' ('I' in French) would be placed in front of a verb that contains a vowel as it's first character. (Ex. "Je [verb]" becomes "J'[verb]")
7) Inclusion of a fix_j_apostrophe(s) function. When translating French to English, occurrences of J' will be translated correctly.
8) Vocabulary increased to 50+ words.
9) Output translations to a text file called 'output.txt'.
10) The domain - most commonly used English words.
11) Comments added.
